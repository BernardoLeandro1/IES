In lab1.1 we learn how to set up maven. In my case, I had already used Maven, so it was already setted up. 

In lab1.2 we create and explore our first maven project of this class.

    ex2 is the creation of a maven project.

    d is the exercise d from lab1_2, where we will use an api from IPMA -> http://api.ipma.pt/ 
    
        For this we use 2 different dependencies, to insert in POM file -> Retrofit (https://square.github.io/retrofit/) and Gson (https://github.com/google/gson)
            Retrofit is a type-safe HTTP client for Java, that allows mapping an external REST API into a local (Java) interface.
            Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation.

        In the pom.xml file I inserted developer, changed the java version and inserted character encoder

In lab1.3 we learn about git, add .gitignore files to the projects.
In this exercise I wasn't really sure what was asked, in d) e) f)









From now on, groupID = labX and artifactID = exY, X being the lab number and Y being the exercise number from labX
