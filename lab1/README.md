In lab1.1 we learn how to set up maven. In my case, I had already used Maven, so it was already setted up. 

In lab1.2 we create and explore our first maven project of this class.

    ex2 is the creation of a maven project.

    d is the exercise d from lab1_2, where we will use an api from IPMA -> http://api.ipma.pt/ 
    
        For this we use 2 different dependencies, to insert in POM file -> Retrofit (https://square.github.io/retrofit/) and Gson (https://github.com/google/gson)
            Retrofit is a type-safe HTTP client for Java, that allows mapping an external REST API into a local (Java) interface.
            Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation.

        In the pom.xml file I inserted developer, changed the java version and inserted character encoder

In lab1.3 we learn about git, add .gitignore files to the projects.

    In this exercise i cloned my repo in location2 and made some changes

In lab1.4 we learned about docker and some important commands. 

We learned what is a Dockerfile (text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image) and a docker-compose.yml file (you use a YAML file to configure your application's services)


In lab 1.5, I needed to put the artifact of ipmaclient on the pom.xml of weatherforecast 

During this lab I also made a general notebook, which will be updated in every lab, that contains the most important/useful commands.


From now on, groupID = labX and artifactID = exY, X being the lab number and Y being the exercise number from labX
